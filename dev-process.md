# Script and Tool Development Process

## Introduction

As a meticulous and organised developer, I follow a structured approach to crafting scripts and tools that align with stakeholder requirements. This process ensures the final product is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## Requirements Gathering

The first step in developing a script or tool is collecting requirements from stakeholders. This includes:

- Identifying the necessary technologies and data types for importing and exporting.
- Determining the target environment and platform (e.g., web-based, Linux).
- Assessing language-specific requirements based on runtime constraints.
- Evaluating security needs for sensitive information transfer, including encryption methods.
- Identifying specialised tasks the tool must perform, such as:
  - Monitoring changes in external systems (e.g., Jira support tickets).
  - Adding custom functionality to cloud-based services (e.g., Jira Cloud) that may not be available out of the box.
  - Generating reports on specific datasets (e.g., daily ticket summaries, open and resolved tickets).
  - Backing up system files and performing iterative backups to ensure data integrity.
  - Integrating with other tools or systems to automate workflows or enhance functionality.

By considering these specialised tasks during the requirements gathering phase, I design tools that meet the precise needs of stakeholders and/or development teams, delivering value beyond basic functionality. This often involves researching APIs, integration options, and other technical details to ensure seamless interaction between the tool and external systems.

## Design and Prototyping

Next, I create a basic workflow and prototype design document that outlines the required processes and steps. This document may include:

- Visual representations of the workflow (e.g., flowcharts, diagrams).
- Text-based descriptions of each process and step.
- Collaboration with team members and stakeholders to validate the approach.

## Iterative Development

With a solid design in place, I develop prototype scripts and iterate on specific routines to identify the most effective solutions. This involves:

- Creating and refining individual components.
- Collaborating with team members via chat and version control systems (e.g., Git).
- Refactoring code to ensure modularity and flexibility.

## Tool Refinement and Configuration

Once each routine meets requirements, I refactor the code into a cohesive toolset. This includes:

- Avoiding hardcoded variables by using configuration files or command-line parameters.
- Creating well-documented configuration files for easy customisation.
- Ensuring flexibility in usage (e.g., compatibility with Bash scripts, Jenkins, or Ansible).

## Testing and Debugging

To ensure reliability and performance, I conduct thorough testing and debugging in a controlled environment. This involves:

- Simulating various scenarios and platforms.
- Identifying and addressing potential issues.

## Documentation and Maintenance

Finally, I prepare comprehensive documentation for both developers and end-users, including:

- Detailed explanations of each section and process within the tool.
- Clear instructions and examples for end-users.
- Regular maintenance and updates to ensure the tool remains efficient and effective.

## Example Use Cases

- Developing a data import/export script for a web-based application.
- Creating a Linux-based tool for automating system administration tasks.
- Building a Jenkins plugin for continuous integration and deployment.

## Tools and Technologies

- Programming languages (e.g., Python, Bash, Java).
- Version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN).
- Collaboration platforms (e.g., Slack, Jira).
- Testing frameworks (e.g., Pytest, Unittest).
